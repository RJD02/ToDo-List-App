# A Todo List Backed By Atlas of MongoDB

## It's live [here](https://fathomless-caverns-32756.herokuapp.com/)

## Special Feature:

Creates lists on the fly.

## Not Responsive Yet!

The main focus of this project was to connect to MongoDB using Node.js with express as framework and mongoose as Mongo ODM

## How to create a new List:

1. Go to the site, using above link
2. Edit URL
   eg: https://fathomless-caverns-32756.herokuapp.com/myList
3. Here a new list named as myList is created and has the same look and functionality thanks to ejs templating.
4. Like this you can specify any name after '/', you'll get a capitalized todo list.
